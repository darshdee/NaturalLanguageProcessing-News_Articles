# Natural Language Processing: News Articles

### Overview
This project will dabble in the field of natural language processing where we look to apply clustering algorithms, such as hierarchal and agglonormative clustering, to a dataset of news articles classified by the type of each news article.  We examine whether there exist any signifcant groups or clustrers that the news articles clearly belong to. We are succesful in observing this, as expected. 

Furthermore, we employ supervised learning techniques such as the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm to and determine if it results in a viable predictive model to classify the news articles according to the categories given. 

### Approach
In this report, I follow the most common approach to conducting predictive analytics, such as :
- Exploratory data analysis
- Data wrangling, cleaning, & consolidation
- Statistical feature selection
- Feature engineering: Text vectorization, data type conversions, etc
- Apply clustering techniques and develop predictive models 
- Inference

It is important to note that text data requires, from the analyst, a significant amount of time to wrangle and clean data to represent it in the appropriate format for analysis. As with most data science projects, this part took up the majority of the time spent on this project. 

### Practical use-cases:
Some ideal production use-cases would be as follows: 

- Automated content output: A model such as this can automate the content generation pipeline for a company such as a news organization. For instance, say that company A has identified that their readers respond more about news relating to AI and drone technology in particular. Therefore, a model can be placed at a stage where editors of the company can simply upload their work into a system where this model will classify it a specific type and send it down the appropriate pipeline.

- Marketing: A model such as this will help advertising companies determine what kind of advertisements to display on the appropriate news article in a constant feedback loop.
